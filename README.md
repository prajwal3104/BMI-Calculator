# BMI-Calculator

This was my first python project in which I implemented a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library to make it more user-friendly. The goal of the project was to create a program that allows users to input data, perform calculations and display the results in a visually appealing way, instead of the repetitive task of running the same code in Jupyter notebook every time the user wants to perform a new calculation. The GUI provided a more practical and realistic experience for the user, making the program more interactive and accessible.
